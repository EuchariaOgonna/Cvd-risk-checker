# Cvd-risk-checker
ðŸ«€ CVD Risk Checker App This interactive Streamlit app extends my previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk analysis project. It uses the same trained logistic regression model to help users input their health details and instantly check their risk of CVD. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
